Procedure:

1. Make sure you have two directories: wavelet and rollMedian.
2. Go to rollMedian, compile getRollMedian.cpp.
3. In rollMedian dir, run dcf2dat.m, make dat file from dcf file. Dat file contains the windowLen and dataLen information, etc.
4. Run getRollMedian, get dat.med file from dat file. Dat.med file contains the rolling median and mad value.
5. Then go to wavelet directory, run wavePick to get the peaks.
